            <p className="mt-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">U-locks tend to be more durable than thin cable locks, which can be cut through more easily. But because of their shape, U-locks limit the amount of bike you can secure at one time, so consider pairing yours with a sturdy steel chain.</p>

            <p className="mt-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">If you choose to double your security by using both a U-lock and a steel chain, first thread the U-lock through to the bike frame, the bike rack or other secure structure, and one wheel. Then, loop the cable lock through both the front and back wheel, as well as through the U-lock.</p>

            <p className="mt-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Seats and wheels on most new bikes come with ‘quick-release’ mechanisms, which make it easy to take them off if you need to load your bike into a car — but they also make your seat and wheels easier to steal. If you don’t need to frequently remove your wheels and seat, consider switching the quick-release skewers for ones that require keys.</p>
